Algorithm

1.  Check is both the passed strings are valid string or not
    1.1.    If valid:  Continue
    1.2.    If not valid: Stop the code execution and return not a valid string
2.  Calculate lenght of both the string and n2
3.  Check if length of both the string is less than 15
    3.1.    If smaller: return the addition of both the strings
    3.2.    If greater: Continue 
4.  Check which parametrised string is greater and call the addition function and store the result into a variable
    4.1.     Addition function
                4.1.1.  Calculate and store the lenght of greater size string
                4.1.2.  Get reverse of both the strings and store them.
                4.1.3.  Start a loop 
                    4.1.3.1.    Loop adds the unit, tense, hundreds.....nth places of both the strings
                    4.1.3.2.    Concats the result with previous addition result
                    4.1.3.3.    Store then addition carry and add it in the next step.
                4.1.4.  Return the addition final result.
5.  Return the result variable as the function o/p
